<h1>The Best Movies According To Shreyash</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>

<p>It's so much fun to watch gangsters, guns, cuss-words and dancing.</p>

<h3>Memento</h3>

<p>Nolan's most underrated movie involving memory loss.</p>

<h3>Mad Max: Fury Road</h3>

<p>
  Never thought such mindless action in a wasteland Australia would become my
  favourite movie of all time.
